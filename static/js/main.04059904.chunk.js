We talked about what was needed to finish the application we \n    have been working on. I was assigned the task of finishing the ingestion script to populate the database and also to get the \n    database deployed on our server. While the front end is working with this new setup I would also need to help correct any problems.\n    \n    To build the ingestion script, I integrated a command into our project using PHP. The spreadsheet has been created using excel, so\n    I needed to create a tool that would read in not just cells from the worksheet, but also be able to switch between multiple worksheets\n    to gather data. To do this, I used a 3rd party library called phpspreadsheet. This allowed me to create a working script to use my entity\n    functions and populate a database.\n    \n    The initial push to move our database and API to a server went fairly smooth. We use npm and composer to track dependencies, so setup was\n    mostly just running install commands and then moving files to the server through WinSCP. However, to run the ingestion script, we needed to\n    install phpspreadsheet, which is a little more tricky. The library requires a 64 bit installation of PHP but what natively is available through\n    xammp is 32 bit. I solved this problem by installing a 64 version in addition to xampp and changing my windows environment variables. This allows\n    me to install the library then move it to the server."},{title:"Week #2 1/14/2019",content:"We were given an important requirement to complete this week - build a unit conversion tool to add to the application. The conversion\n    tool would need to store coefficients and calculate conversion rates before returning a fully converted value. I started my week by building an\n    entity and controller for the backend to get and retrieve the information needed to accomplish this, while also responding to any problems we\n    had resulting from our move to a server last week.\n    \n    One thing we encountered on the server is that file permissions matter quite a lot. POST requests were being treated as GETS and it took a while\n    before a developer realized what the problem was. File permissions needed to be changed to give xammp the power to change things on the server.\n    \n    By midweek I had built the back-end logic to complete our unit conversion tool. I gave these changes to the front-end developers who worked to\n    create a demo-able example. When I returned on Friday, they had built a fully working tool with my API. We now needed to deploy everything to\n    the server. I worked to copy everything once again, and we spent the rest of the day double checking that everything was working."},{title:"Week #3 1/21/2019",content:"This week was my last chance to work with my current mentor. We have finished the back-end project we have been working on for the\n    last few months, so we needed to answer questions for the front-end developers while also moving on to another project. I was tasked with introducing\n    the developers of this new project to Jest testing. I created some quick examples of snapshot tests so that devs could quickly and easily test\n    react components. However, I also needed to develop tests to check that functions are pure. This new project had many helper functions to do a lot of\n    math, and as a requirement they needed to be pure.\n    \n    I created these tests using raw javascript. A pure function must not change its output given the same input. In addition it cannot create side-effects\n    in the application. I not only need to check that the result is the same, but that outside data is not being modified, and that the scope of the function\n    does not affect what is sent into it. I finished these tests at the end of the week and sent them to my mentor to review. Next week I should be put\n    on another project with a new mentor."},{title:"Week #4 1/28/2019",content:"This week began with feedback about my pure function tests. I did not include a change to the package.json file to include Jest because I had\n    it installed globally. This meant that someone downloading my tests would need to perform some additional setup before running them, which I did not\n    document. To remedy this, I wanted to include Jest in the dependencies and include scripts that would run the tests. This would give a developer\n    an easy way to access the tools.\n    \n    I ran into some problems because the application was using an old version of Babel. It was incompatible with Jest and caused the tests to fail.\n    Updating Babel would allow the Jest tests to run, but would crash the app. The solution was to give an old version of Jest as a dependency and keep\n    Babel the same. It took me a while to find this answer, but now the tests will work correctly.\n    \n    Once I had provided a good suite of test tools, I moved on to my new project. I attended some meetings with my new mentor, and got a little familiar with\n    the project. I then began the process of setting up my development environment for the project. We are using Xampp to handle some of the server\n    services and my PHP version seems too new to get the project working. I will need to downgrade my version of Xampp next week."}],I=function(e){function t(){var e,n;Object(r.a)(this,t);for(var o=arguments.length,i=new Array(o),s=0;s<o;s++)i[s]=arguments[s];return(n=Object(d.a)(this,(e=Object(h.a)(t)).call.apply(e,[this].concat(i)))).makeBlogPosts=function(){return k.map(function(e){return a.a.createElement(y,{title:e.title,content:e.content})})},n}return Object(c.a)(t,e),Object(l.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return a.a.createElement("div",null,this.makeBlogPosts())}}]),t}(o.Component),j=function(e){function t(){return Object(r.a)(this,t),Object(d.a)(this,Object(h.a)(t).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(c.a)(t,e),Object(l.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return a.a.createElement("div",null,a.a.createElement(I,null))}}]),t}(o.Component);Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));s.a.render(a.a.createElement(j,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(e){e.unregister()})}},[[16,2,1]]]);
